# 🚉 Managing Safety Accidents in Railways using Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning techniques** such as **K-Means Clustering** and **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** to analyze railway accident data and identify hidden patterns that contribute to safety risks. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making for enhancing passenger and station safety.
